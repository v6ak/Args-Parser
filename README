An commandline arguments parser.
Features:
* extensible: You can write your own option parser
* strict: If you write invallid name of the option or use it as invalid type, it causes compilation error. This is achieved by generics.
* unused option warning: If you have enabled unused variable warning, you will be probably warned if you have an unused option.
* easy to use
